# frozenset is an immutable version of a set.
# Like sets, it contains unique, unordered, unchangeable elements.Unlike sets, elements cannot be added or removed from a frozenset.

#Use the frozenset() constructor to create a frozenset from any iterable.

x=frozenset(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
print("Frozenset:", x)
